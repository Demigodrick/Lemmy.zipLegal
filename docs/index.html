                description: "How users are expected to behave on Lemmy.zip. Also known as a Fair Use policy.",
                content: "Lemmy.zip Code of Conduct - Last Updated 12th March 2024 (Reviewed 19th October 2024)\nIntroduction linkThe Code of Conduct applies to all users of Lemmy.zip, and aims to set out how users (Whether local users or remote users) should interact with eachother in order to create a welcoming and respectful online space. This policy also applies to users who are from other instances who interact with Lemmy.zip communities or users when on Lemmy.zip’s server(s). This policy will also be in effect on other Lemmy.zip affilliated platforms, such as Matrix.\nLemmy.zip Code of Conduct linkThe Lemmy.zip Code of Conduct can be summarised as follows:\nPlease abide by the General Code of Conduct at all times. Remember the human! (no harassment, threats, etc.) No ban evasion on Lemmy.zip or on other instances. No endorsement of hate speech No self-advertisements or spam No link-spamming Bots must be proportional No vote manipulation No content against UK law. Any NSFW post must be tagged as NSFW. Remember the Human linkAll interactions on Lemmy.zip should be assumed that the entity on the other end of the interaction is a Human. Therefore we expect that you treat them in the same way that you want to be treated on Lemmy.zip - With respect.\nNo ban evasion linkThis rule applies for both Lemmy.zip and for other Lemmy/Fediverse servers. If you are a Lemmy.zip user and your account is banned from a community (whether that be on Lemmy.zip or on another instance) then you MUST respect that ban. You MUST NOT create a new account on Lemmy.zip or on a different Lemmy/Fediverse server in order to evade the ban. This will result in your original and new account(s) being permanently banned from Lemmy.zip.\nIf you are a remote user (an account that was not created on Lemmy.zip) and you have been banned from a community on Lemmy.zip, then you MUST NOT create an account on a different Lemmy/Fediverse server in order to evade the ban. This will result in us further banning your account from all of Lemmy.zip, and reporting the matter to your home instance(s).\nYou cannot create an account on Lemmy.zip in order to evade a ban your account on a different instance has been given. This will result in use permanently banning both your Lemmy.zip account and your remote account(s) from Lemmy.zip.\nNo endorsement of hate speech linkYou have a responsibility to report hate speech, which may be classed as illegal depending on the severity of the content. Agreeing with, sharing, promoting, or encouraging hate speech will result in a warning or a ban in cases of continued rule breaking.\nNo self-advertising or spam linkAny accounts created in order to only promote a product, brand or idea may be banned at the discretion of the Admins.\nAny accounts created in order to create spam in the network will be banned.\nNo link-spamming linkYou MUST NOT create multiple posts or comments in order to spam a link. This will result in a ban.\nBots must be proportional linkWe are happy for bots to operate on Lemmy.zip, but they must be proportional to the communities they operate in, and not create spam, duplicated posts, or fake interactions. Bots who break these rules will be banned at the discretion of the Admins. The creator(s) must also be aware of the strain some bots can place on the server, any bots found to be negatively affecting the performance of the server will result in the bot AND the operator(s) account(s) being banned.\nNo vote manipulation linkThis applies to Lemmy.zip users interacting with Lemmy.zip content or other server’s content, and it also applies to users from other instances interacting with Lemmy.zip content. This can be from mass upvoting/downvoting the comments of a certain user or on a user’s own posts, or it can be a user who downvotes every post in a community or that a user makes.\nDownvoting content can be a good way to identify low-quality content but, for example, downvoting all new posts in a community would most likely violate this policy.\nBans will be issued at the discretion of the Admins.\nNo content against UK Law linkThe UK has strict laws around hate speech and illegal content posted on the internet. As someone who lives in the UK, I don’t particularly fancy being arrested over someone’s low effort racist/homophobic comment. Therefore all content MUST abide by UK law. If in doubt, check with the Admins. More information can be found HERE. You can also report hate crimes via that website, however the Admins would prefer you let them know first.\nNSFW content tagging linkYou MUST flag any and all content as NSFW. Any content not correctly tagged will be removed, and a warning will be issued. Repeat offenders will face a ban.\nIf you’re unsure if content might be NSFW, please consider if you would want your boss, coworkers, or elderly grandmother to see it. If not, it needs to be tagged NSFW.\nPlease also follow the rules of the community you are posting in, sometimes NSFW also acts as a “Content Warning” outside of the specific NSFW communities.\nSummary linkThe crux of it boils down to:\n- Remember that we are all humans - Don’t be overtly aggressive towards anyone - Try and share ideas, thoughts and criticisms in a constructive way - Tag any NSFW posts as such Any posts or comments that are in breach of these rules will be dealt with, and remediation will occur. Whether that be a warning, temporary ban, or permanent ban.\nContact us linkIf you think a post, comment or message should be removed, please use the report functionality built into Lemmy. If you are unable to report the content, you can email us via hello@lemmy.zip and we will take action.\nLemmy Dev General Code of Conduct linkThe Lemmy Devs have published a General Code of Conduct. The below is a slightly modified version and is the basis for the Lemmy.zip code of conduct - we view these as guidelines to interactions on Lemmy.zip, and we may apply these in addition to the Lemmy.zip Code of Conduct above.\nGeneral Code of Conduct: link We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic. Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other usernames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude. Respect that people have differences of opinion. We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term “harassment” as including the definition in the Citizen Code of Conduct; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don’t tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups. Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the Lemmy admin team immediately. Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome. Moderator Code of Conduct linkIf you moderate a community on Lemmy.zip, you have some extra responsibilities you must abide by.\nCommunity Rules linkWhen you create a community, you have the ability to set rules above those posted above. Any rules you post must be in compliance with the above rules. You cannot apply a rule that contradicts the above Lemmy.zip rules. You will recieve a warning and be asked to fix the issue first, but repeat offenders or those who do not take action will be removed as moderators from the community and may face an account ban. The community may also be deleted at the discretion of an Admin.\nReports linkYou have the responsibility to act upon any reports recieved that relate to the content in the community you moderate. You must consider if the content breaches any of the above rules, and if so you must take action to remove that content, and issue warnings or bans in relation to that content.\nModerators should be aware that Admins also receive reports from users, and may take action prior to your involvement, or may override your decision. This is never personal, is rarely done, and is only done to protect the server acting on information that may result in a more severe form of punishment for the user.\nUser bans linkYou have the ability to ban a user if they break the rules in your community. You should not ban a user for their actions in another community, rather this should be reported to the relevant moderators and admins to deal with. Bans should not be used to abuse users or stifle conversations, and where Admins believe bans are being targetted at users as a form of abuse, the moderator will be removed and banned.\nHowever, the Admins will 100% stand behind moderators when they make genuine bans and deal with day to day issues.\nAutomated Tools linkLemmy.zip provides a range of automated tools for moderators to use to help support their communities (such as the RSS feed or autopost feature). These tools are provided with the expectation they will be used in a fair and transparent way. Misuse of these tools, i.e. using these tools in a way that is not intended, targetting users, or creating spam, will result in the community being removed from the moderator and a ban to the moderator’s account. If you’re not sure, ask an Admin first.\nContact us linkIf you want to discuss any aspect of being a moderator, please contact us via Lemmy or email hello@lemmy.zip.\n"

                description: "How Lemmy.zip handles defederating with other Instances",
                content: "Lemmy.zip Defederation Policy - Last Updated 4th November 2023 (Reviewed 19th October 2024)\nAdministration and Defederation Policy for Lemmy.zip linkThis policy aims to clarify principles for how administration and federation is done on Lemmy.zip. It is intended to be an overview of general guidelines, not a formal set of rules.\nInstance rules linkThis instance has a set of rules which are available in our Code of Conduct and Terms of Service. All users of this instance are expected to follow these rules in all of their activities, including:\nCommunity moderation Posting Commenting Our rules apply even when you’re posting in a community on another instance. For example, this means that you’re not allowed to post advertisement spam using your Lemmy.zip account on any other instance (even if that other instance has no rules).\nEach community hosted on Lemmy.zip is free to have additional rules in addition to our instance wide rules, but instance rules supercede any community rules and must always be enforced.\nResponsibilities linkAdmins link Ensure that there are no communities on lemmy.zip which break lemmy.zip rules Ban lemmy.zip users who break our rules on other instances Ban users who consistently break rules across multiple communities Purge illegal content from lemmy.zip Moderators link Ensure that posts and comments in their communities don’t break rules Ban users from their communities for consistently breaking rules Users link Downvote low quality content Report rule violations ⚠️ Admins are not responsible for censoring content from other instances. ⚠️\nOur rules on other Instances linkIn exceptional cases (illegal or extremely disturbing content), admins will step in and purge the content from Lemmy.zip servers, but in general it is understood that our instance rules do not apply to external users on other instances, and censoring and curating external instances for our users is not a function for Lemmy.zip Admins.\nDefederation linkLemmy is a federated network, so a lot of content will be posted on other instances. It is possible to limit which instances Lemmy.zip is federated with, this is called defederation.\nDefederating another instance has the following effects:\nOur users will stop seeing new posts and comments from users of the defederated instance (on all instances) Users of the defederated instance will stop seeing new posts and comments from our users Users of the defederated instance will be prevented from participating in communities hosted on Lemmy.zip As mentioned above, it is not a goal for Lemmy.zip to censor and curate external instances. While there are certainly instances which contain content that wouldn’t be allowed on this instance, breaking our rules outside of this instance is not by itself enough of a reason for us to defederate other instances.\nWe absolutely will defederate any instance which is posting illegal or extremely questionable content. This is up to the discretion of our Admins. Some concrete examples of instances which we would defederate:\nAn instance which is focused on creating spam in the network An instance which systematically allows large groups of users to break lemmy.zip rules in communities hosted on lemmy.zip An instance which is knowingly spreading CSAM into the federated network Community Vote linkWhere an instance is dedicated to creating questionable content, we won’t immediately defederate but will instead ask the community to vote on what they would like to happen next. We will announce these votes in advance, and users can place their vote during the stated time period.\nIt is important to note that while a vote is driving factor in the choice to defederate, there may be cases where the admins will decide to defederate anyway, against the outcome of a community vote, if remaining federated would jeopardise the Lemmy.zip instance by violating local laws or where remaining federated would bring the instance into disrepute.\nUsers of Lemmy.zip can request a vote at any time by sending a message to an admin, preferably with evidence of the instance’s questionable content, and the administration team will discuss taking it forward to public vote.\nWhat should I do if I see content I don’t like on another instance? link If it’s low quality content, you should always downvote ⬇️ If you think it breaks local rules for the community or instance, then report it and local admins/mods will deal with it Your reports will also reach lemmy.zip admins, so if it’s about illegal content, then we can purge it from lemmy.zip servers If it’s just some user being an idiot, then you can block that specific user (Lemmy.zip admins will not take action in case of external users posting on external communities) If it’s a community dedicated to being awful in some way, then you can block that specific community in your user settings. Defederated Instances linkThis is a list of the Defederated Instances and the reasons behind the defederation. You can also view this by going to https://lemmy.zip/instances and scrolling down until you find the “Blocked Instances” list.\nThreads.net - User Vote burggit.moe - CSAM kbin.cafe - CSAM (No active moderation) rqd2.net - Advocating relationships with minors "
